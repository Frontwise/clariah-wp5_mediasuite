    "intro": "<p>The CLARIAH Media Suite provides access to \"established\" collections from different institutions (e.g., television broadcasts from The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, selected sub-collections from EYE Film Museum, newspapers from the National Library (KB), thematic oral history collections from DANS, among others). All collections (and sub-collections) are registered in a common inventory built in CKAN. CKAN is an open source platform for collection registration, it is a software solution that provides the tools to \"streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data\", making it accessible. CKAN aims to making collections all over the world easily discovered and accessed.</p><p>In the CLARIAH Media SuiteÂ´s instance of CKAN you can find the metadata about the collections, and the metadata (i.e., the data) of the collections. Most collections are available both in Elasticsearch and RDF formats, and some in either of the two. Access to the media objects (i.e., to the content itself) depends on the policies of each data provider. The data that is \"registered\" in CKAN is used by the tools in the Media Suite.</p>",

You will be redirected to an external service (http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset), built using the CKAN registration software.</li><li>In that page, you can see the datasets that are registered in CKAN by the Media Studies focus of CLARIAH.</li><li>You can search registered datasets by using tags (thematic, media types), organizations (creators of the datasets or collections), or groups (groups are used to organise datasets by data provider). Please be aware that these tags, organizations and groups refer to the \"dataset level\", not to the content itself.</li><li>If you want to search the content of the datasets, go to the \"Tools\" section of the Media Suite. You will find a \"Collection selector\" in each tool, which will give you the list of available/registered collections in CKAN that you can search or browse.</li><li>Registering your own datasets is not supported yet. Please Contact us if you have any questions.</li></ul>  <p>For curators/data owners:</p><ul><li>The current instance of CKAN implemented for the CLARIAH media studies focus includes datasets that we have registered (by harvesting or importing them) on behalf of the collection owners. In the near future, more organisations can register their collections and add data themselves. Registration with an open licence is possible, but private access is also an option. The data itself can be added to each registered collection using different formats (e.g., XML, JSON, RDF). Please Contact us if you are interested in providing/enabling access to Data in CLARIAH in general, or in the CLARIAH Media Suite specifically.</li></ul><p>Note: CLARIAH also offers other data registration services (see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.clariah.nl/files/wp/wp2_anansi_project_brief.pdf\">Anansi - Doc</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://vimeo.com/186090384\">Anansi - Video</a>, merging these services is work in progress.</p><p>For questions or suggestions related to the Data services of the CLARIAH Media Suite, please use our chat room in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gitter.im/CLARIAH-media-studies/Collections-Data\">Gitter</a></p>"
